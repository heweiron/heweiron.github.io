<h1>Project: Homework Tracker</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

*The problem*: Many students have an issue of doing their homework on time because there are so many courses and they may mix up some homework and forget to do it. They need a notification to push them to finish their assignments.

*The solution*: The Homework Tracker website allows students to logo in and list all the homework and its due day. So students can have a concept of their homework and use this app to organize their study time.


<h3>Approach</h3>
There are two different roles. Professors can register an account with their ID as Professor to post homework for students. Students need to register an account with their student ID.
Once students finish their registration, they are able to search courses based on corresponding CRN and add them as chosen courses for this semester, and the homework will be automatically added to their schedules. Students can list the homework of all subjects on the corresponding due date. Students can mark the homework that they have already finished to clean up their daily schedules. The site will keep tracking on the unmarked homework and remind students on the due date. 

Professors can post homework for their students. The homework only shows up for students who selected the course. Professors are able to edit the due date and content for each homework section, and 

<h3>Mock up page idea</h3>
