Since I was a kid, I have seen many television shows about hackers. I thought that a senario that  a gay is keep tying and the code is generating line by lineon the computer is so cool. However, after I grew up, I realized that hacker is illegal. Therefore, instead of being a hacker, I choose to be a software developer. When adviser ask me about my major, I replied to him immediately that ICS will be my future major. The reason why I choose ICS as my major is that I have a lot of interests in software engineering.

There are many factors that make me interested in software engineering. The first thing is that I can solve many hard tasks by writing a code. Computers can do more and faster than human beings. Developing a software can help humans to solve problems easily and quickly. For example, if the task requires to print a sentence a hundred times, a for loop can help humans to save plenty of time. Second, I also find interest in debugging a program. Most people cannot write a code that has no bugs at first time. Therefore, debugging is a very important step for programmer. During the time when I was debugging a code I wrote, it feels so good when I saw the bug is becoming less and less each time I run the compiler. After testing and I found that the program actually works, I will be full of satisfaction and pleasure. The third interest I have on software engineering is that it created many chances for me to discuss and work with others. As we know, a big project often requires a group of people to cooperate to finish the task. I am very willing to work with others because it will help me to learn more knowledge from others and help me to make more new friends. The last but not least, software engineering can teach me many knowledge and skills in my future life.

I am so interested in this field but I am just a beginner of computer science and I have a lot of things need to learn. I would like to develop my skill of solving problems efficiently because one of my issues is that I need more time than others on one problem. I will practice more to make me to code faster. The other skill I like to develop is teamwork capabilities. English is my second language, so I feel shy when I communicate with others. In the future, I will try my best to work with others and share my ideas with them during cooperation.
