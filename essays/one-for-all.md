### Introduction
Time is like an unleashed arrow, flies fast and never come back. The learning experience of web design is almost
finish. Fortunately, those passed time is not wasted. From four months practicing on web design, I learned a lot
software engineer concepts like coding standards and design pattern, and these knowledge from one class can also apply
 on my future
 life.

### Coding Standards
Coding standards are very important concept in web design because the readability of a code directly affect the
 quality of the program. Coding standards are literally just some rules of coding. For example, the ESlint which I
  practiced for a whole semester prefer single quote on String. The fact is even though we keep using double quotes
  , the code is still running well if they is no crashing error. However, following coding standards is extremely
   important in software engineering.
   
There is one time I forget to enable the ESlint to check my coding style. That assignment is to modify a website page
 with plain HTML
 and I choose to do a very complicated page which contains a lot of information. Therefore, I wrote hundreds of lines
  and finally it looks exactly the same as original website page. However, about two weeks later, I was assigned to
   modify the same page using React. So I look at my code with plaint HTML again, and I found that I totally cannot
    understand my own code. The reason why is that I did not follow the coding standards and the code was messed up
     which makes it unreadable. After I enabling the ESlint and fix all the coding style error, I was able to start
      understand the meaning of my own code. After this experience, I realized the importance of following ciding
       standards.
       
The concept of coding standards can not only apply to the web design, but also can apply on anywhere. First, all
 languages have their own standards like Java also have a checkstyle to find the style error of our code. Fortunately
 , the standards of these coding languages are very similar to each other. Therefore, the experience in this semester
  can also help to improve my skill to code with other languages. In addition, our coding have standards to make it
   nicer, same does our life. We must also live with some base line, and knowing things we can do, and things we
    cannot. It will make our life looks better.
   
### Design Patterns 
 Design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software
  design. Building a program is just like putting items into an empty room. The easiest way to do it is that directly put them inside the room. However, after putting too many items in the room, it becomes very difficult for us if we want to find something or make a change of a certain item. Therefore, some boxes may be very helpful. If we put some kind of items into the same box, then when we want to find this item we can directly go to that box and find that item easily. Learning of design patterns is like learning the rules of using these boxes to hold items.
  
  Design Patterns are applied on web design a lot. For example, the Observer Pattern is that the dependencies of an
   object can get notification when that object changed its state. This pattern is applied whenever we implement a
    onClick function in a button. There are a lot of patterns that are very useful in our web design experience. Same
     as the coding standards, it can also be used in many other computing environment. Design Patterns are the
      pattern for all computer science programmers. Learning it can help us to save a lot of time because once we
       familiar with this concept, we can know general solution for many problems.
       
  We can also learn a lot from design patterns for
   our daily life.  Design Patterns are just the summarizing of coding problem solution so programmers can use it as
    a example to slove problems. In our daily life, although there is no such summarized pattern, we can open the eye
     of our heart, pay more attention to the problems around us and create our own life patterns to make our life
      better.
      
### Conclusion
There are many concepts that covered this semester which can be applied on other fields beside web design. I am glad
 that I did not wasted my time and learned a lot from this semester. All the concepts I learned can be a very helpful
  assistant to benefit my future life.
