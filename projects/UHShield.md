## HACC 2020
<a href="https://hacc.hawaii.gov/">Hawaii Annual Code Challenge</a> is a hackathon that encouraged civic engagement with the local technology community in modernizing state functions and services for a more effective, efficient and open government. Participants can form a team and select one of the challenges from the list and provide their unique solution for it. This year, I attended HACC 2020 and won THIRD PLACE with this project.

## Project Overview

Some UH buildings required significant access control, and the building security of unknown vistor become a very big problem. UH staffs had to share a spreedsheet to record all the guest and manually review the sheet for all guest and physically monitor those suspicious visitors. To provide more convienence to UH staffs, we building this mobile APP called UHShield. UHShield is a powerful APP that can easily setup new event and invite guest to come to the building and efficiently check with guest identity and provide security to the building.
 
### For Sponsor:

   - Sponsors can use our APP to create new event and then send invitation email with QR-Code to their guests.
   - UHShield will automaticly check place or time conflict before creating event
   - Sponsors can also easily manage their own events: edit or delete. 
   - When guests showed up, sponsor can use our APP to take attendance of checked in guests.
   - Sponsors can browse all the events in the campus and use search function to quick look up for a certain event.
 
### For Reception:

   - Receptionists are assigned to a certain building which is their workplace.
   - They just need scan the QR-Code provided by guest to make check in.
   - If guest don't have QR-Code, receptionists can also use event list of the day or search function to make check in.
   - After successfully checked in, receptionists should assigned a physical badge to each guest and using our APP to record badge.
   - Receptionists also need to recycle badges from guest and delete badge information as check out.
   
   
## My Contribution

In this project, my job is focus on UI design and some core functionality. I designed sign in, sign up views, event row UI, and sponsor manage events view UI. I am proud of building a QR-Code generator and scanning functionality for eadily check in. In addition, I also make contribution on sending eamil functionality inside the APP.
