Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The player controls a square on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. The snake continually gets longer as it moves. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, a trail or itself.

* The game will let user choose a hard level which decide the speed of snake's moving. 
* User can use direction key from their keybord to control the moving direction of snake. 
* [space] button can make game pause. 

There is still issue that the screen will blink which need to be solved.
